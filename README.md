# Project: Comparative Analysis of Linear Algebra in MATLAB and Python
The final project in DSC210
SVD part
For the image processing part of svd, we used matlab and python libraries to complete the task, thereby comparing the running times in different languages ​​and different image types.
In this experiment, we selected three types of images: a portrait of a person, a low-frequency indoor image, and a high-frequency natural landscape image.

Human Portraits: These images usually require high fidelity in details and colors, especially for facial features.

Low-frequency Indoor Images: Such images often contain smoother regions and fewer detail variations, making them potentially easier to compress.

High-frequency Natural Scenery Images: These types of images usually have a lot of details and complex textures, posing higher demands on the fidelity of the compression algorithm.
